# Debugging  

## Using Browser

David taught me to use conditional print statements to stop the code at a particular iteration and print some output. A better way of doing this is using the `browser()` which can trigger when the `expr` is equal to `TRUE`. In the following example the loop will pause at iteration 556 and allow you to interactively debugging. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:1000) {
  browser(expr = (i==556))
}
```
